HTTP request logger middleware for node.js

> Named after [Dexter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_Morgan), a show you should not watch until completion.

## API

```js
var express = require('express')
var morgan  = require('morgan')

var app = express()
app.use(morgan('combined'))
```

### morgan(format, options)

Create a new morgan logger middleware function using the given `format` and `options`.
The `format` argument may be a string of a predefined name (see below for the names),
a string of a format string, or a function that will produce a log entry.

```js
// a pre-defined name
morgan('combined')

// a format string
morgan(':remote-addr :method :url')

// a custom function
morgan(function (morgan, req, res) {
  return req.method + ' ' + req.url
})
```

#### Options

Morgan accepts these properties in the options object.

#### buffer

Buffer duration before writing logs to the `stream`, defaults to `false`. When
set to `true`, defaults to `1000 ms`.

#### immediate

Write log line on request instead of response. This means that a requests will
be logged even if the server crashes, _but data from the response (like the
response code, content length, etc.) cannot be logged_.

##### skip

Function to determine if logging is skipped, defaults to `false`. This function
will be called as `skip(req, res)`.

```js
// only log error responses
morgan('combined', {
  skip: function (req, res) { return res.statusCode < 400 }
})
```

##### stream

Output stream for writing log lines, defaults to `process.stdout`.

#### Predefined Formats

There are various pre-defined formats provided:

##### combined

Standard Apache combined log output.

```
:remote-addr - :remote-user [:date] ":method :url HTTP/:http-version" :status :res[content-length] ":referrer" ":user-agent"
```

##### common

Standard Apache common log output.

```
:remote-addr - :remote-user [:date] ":method :url HTTP/:http-version" :status :res[content-length]
```

##### dev

Concise output colored by response status for development use. The `:status`
token will be colored red for server error codes, yellow for client error
codes, cyan for redirection codes, and uncolored for all other codes.

```
:method :url :status :response-time ms - :res[content-length]
```

##### short

Shorter than default, also including response time.

```
:remote-addr :remote-user :method :url HTTP/:http-version :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms
```

##### tiny

The minimal output.

```
:method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms
```

#### Tokens

- `:req[header]` ex: `:req[Accept]`
- `:res[header]` ex: `:res[Content-Length]`
- `:http-version`
- `:response-time`
- `:remote-addr`
- `:remote-user`
- `:date`
- `:method`
- `:url`
- `:referrer`
- `:user-agent`
- `:status`

To define a token, simply invoke `morgan.token()` with the name and a callback function. The value returned is then available as ":type" in this case:
```js
morgan.token('type', function(req, res){ return req.headers['content-type']; })
```
